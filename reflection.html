                <dc>T</dc>he commitment for a clean-cut victory against the Soviets led the CIA to choose war over peace. In fact, Gorbachev had promised to remove Soviet troops from Afghanistan and had asked for a united government that incorporated elements of both the KGB-backed Najibullah regime in Kabul and the CIA-backed Islamic fundamentalists. However, because of Defense Secretary Robert Gates’ believing that the mujahideen could easily defeat the Najibullah regime after the Soviets’ pulling out, he turned down the plans for peace and insisted on a forceful takeover. In his memoir, Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote “I told [the CIA] that most analysts did not believe Najibullah’s government could last without active Soviet military support.” As a result, when the George H. W. Bush administration entered office in 1989, instead of negotiating their geostrategic aims towards peace, continued the U.S. covert support for the mujahideen. However, Najibullah’s regime defied the CIA’s expectation of rapid collapse, beating back the mujahideen offensive for over three years. As Najibullah hung on, the war, the violence, and the disorder continued. (Parry) As historian Stephen Tanner says, the following years only strengthened the Soviet claim that the mujahideen, once in power, would result in disaster.

                Furthermore, the endgame that followed the war, resulting in an Afghan insurgency, was not entirely the fault of Wilson’s. He had proposed numerous bills to try to rebuild Afghanistan for the better, most notably HO-118, which proposed the reconstruction of schools and villages. However, Congress, exhausted by the war, refused, leading to private armies clashing to gain power. (Conan)

                <p>Wilson had admitted, “It would have been very easy and done for a minuscule amount of money. We should have done the basic things for a backward country that's trying to come out of (a war) and have a reasonable hope of economic success.” (Crile, 2007)

                Wilson’s legacy remains that of a thirty-year Afghan civil war, the Taliban, and a misguided U.S. strategy of intervention. Although he is largely responsible for helping the mujahideen defeat the Soviet Army and advancing the collapse of the USSR, his poor execution afterwards left the region politically unstable and factionalized, causing decades of civil war and fundamentalism that that still affect us today.
