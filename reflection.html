	              <dc>T</dc>he rapid growth of the Taliban and radical Islamic groups could be attributed to the actions of George W. Bush in the events following 9/11 rather than Wilson. When the Bush administration publicly announced that Pakistan was building an atomic bomb, it was clear to the Afghan mujahideen and the Taliban what the U.S.’s intentions were. During the war, the U.S. and Pakistan worked on an agreement that stated that Pakistan would help fight the Soviets for the U.S. if the U.S. supplied aid to the country and would not speak up about Pakistan’s construction of a nuclear warhead (Crile). However, since the U.S. had broken the agreement and with the Russians gone, the U.S. imposed immediate sanctions on Pakistan and made Pakistan an enemy for funding known terrorist groups. To the Afghan and Pakistani people, the U.S. began looking like another country who would come to dominate the Middle East. These actions only reinforced groups like the Taliban and Al Qaeda’s claims that the U.S. was seeking world domination, and helped them gather immense support.

                Moreover, the commitment for a clean-cut victory against the Soviets led the CIA to choose war over peace. In fact, Gorbachev had promised to remove Soviet troops from Afghanistan and had asked for a united government that incorporated elements of both the KGB-backed Najibullah regime in Kabul and the CIA-backed Islamic fundamentalists. However, because of Defense Secretary Robert Gates’ believing that the mujahideen could easily defeat the Najibullah regime after the Soviets’ pulling out, he turned down the plans for peace and insisted on a forceful takeover. In his memoir, Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote “I told [the CIA] that most analysts did not believe Najibullah’s government could last without active Soviet military support.” As a result, when the George H. W. Bush administration entered office in 1989, instead of negotiating their geostrategic aims towards peace, continued the U.S. covert support for the mujahideen. However, Najibullah’s regime defied the CIA’s expectation of rapid collapse, beating back the mujahideen offensive for over three years. As Najibullah hung on, the war, the violence, and the disorder continued. (Parry) As historian Stephen Tanner says, the following years only strengthened the Soviet claim that the mujahideen, once in power, would result in disaster.

                Furthermore, the endgame that followed the war, resulting in an Afghan insurgency, was not entirely the fault of Wilson’s. He had proposed numerous bills to try to rebuild Afghanistan for the better, most notably HO-118, which proposed the reconstruction of schools and villages. However, Congress, exhausted by the war, refused, leading to private armies clashing to gain power. (Conan)

                Wilson’s legacy remains that of a thirty-year Afghan civil war, the Taliban, and a misguided U.S. strategy of intervention. Although he is largely responsible for helping the mujahideen defeat the Soviet Army and advancing the collapse of the USSR, his poor execution afterwards left the region politically unstable and factionalized, causing decades of civil war and fundamentalism that that still affect us today.
