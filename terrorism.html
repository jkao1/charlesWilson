	              <dc>T</dc>he rapid growth of the Taliban and radical Islamic groups could be attributed to the actions of George W. Bush in the events following 9/11 rather than Wilson. When the Bush administration publicly announced that Pakistan was building an atomic bomb, it was clear to the Afghan mujahideen and the Taliban what the U.S.’s intentions were. During the war, the U.S. and Pakistan worked on an agreement that stated that Pakistan would help fight the Soviets for the U.S. if the U.S. supplied aid to the country and would not speak up about Pakistan’s construction of a nuclear warhead (Crile). However, since the U.S. had broken the agreement and with the Russians gone, the U.S. imposed immediate sanctions on Pakistan and made Pakistan an enemy for funding known terrorist groups. To the Afghan and Pakistani people, the U.S. began looking like another country who would come to dominate the Middle East. These actions only reinforced groups like the Taliban and Al Qaeda’s claims that the U.S. was seeking world domination, and helped them gather immense support.

                On September 11th, 2001, al-Qaeda militants hijacked four airliners. Two of the planes hit the towers of the World Trade Center, and one hit the Pentagon. There were nine thousand casualties in total. It’s difficult to not relate this incident to Wilson’s actions in Afghanistan. With his and the CIA’s gratuitous funding, the U.S. had directly armed and trained Afghan insurgents for acts of terror such as these.
